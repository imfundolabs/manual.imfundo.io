		<p class="desc_text" align="center">Creator's manual is a book that will assist you in using the blackbox. It has
											many activities and projects that you can do with the components from blackbox.
											The activities are presented in a step by step way accompanied by diagrams and
											explanations wherever required.<br><br>
											The activities and projects are planned across two levels, with each level
											spanning one academic year, as described below.<br>

		<ul id="treemenu1" class="treeview">
			<li><b style="color:#FBB040;">Level 1</b>
				<p class="section_head_desc">It is the very first step of student into maker’s world. This is dedicated to understanding the
											basics of mechanics, electronics and computing while building small gadgets as we proceed. Students
											will then use the concepts learnt previously to build some projects on their own.
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Mechanics</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">With the pre-requisites of basic mathematical tools like ratio and proportions, students perform
											various activities using Levers, Gears and Cams. This will help students to understand how they can
											use such components for having mechanical advantage whenever required.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Harnessing the power of levers to help lift heavier objects with lesser efforts</li>
							<li>Understanding gears and rotational motion</li>
							<li>Using gears to adjust speed</li>
							<li>Gear Ratio – use gears to make a machine</li>
							<li>Pushing things with the wheel – converting rotational motion to linear motion</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Electronics</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">From understanding battery, glowing a bulb and constructing a fan to building fan regulators and
											touch switch – blackbox has components to teach the basics of electronics and hence to help student
											in making gadgets. This will help students to understand how they can use electrical energy to reduce
											human effort.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Understanding battery, voltage and current</li>
							<li>Make your first circuit on breadboard to control a fan and a lamp using switch</li>
							<li>Adjusting fan’s speed & controlling the lamp’s intensity using variable resistances</li>
							<li>Building your own household circuit</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Computing</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">To automate things, one needs to feed prior instructions in the machine. Hence, this section starts
											off with learning to design instructions and then writing them in a language which can be understood by
											machines in the form of a program. This course uses Arduino UNO (a standard open-source platform being
											used globally by makers and enthusiasts) as the programmable medium which then executes those
											instructions.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Blinking a lamp at regular intervals autonomously</li>
							<li>A simple doorbell which buzzes on pressing the switch</li>
							<li>Sound patterns using a simple buzzer</li>
							<li>Reducing fan’s speed, buzzer’s sound and lamp’s intensity using programming</li>
							<li>Make your own train station display (as seen in Metro trains)</li>
							<li>Program the number display (as seen on traffic signals) to count for you</li>
							<li>Control a motor and make it run in both directions without disturbing the wires</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Projects</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">With a minimal assistance from our end, students will work on a variety of projects on their own.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Secret Chatting – sending messages using MORSE Code using LED</li>
							<li>3 Shade Lamp – a color changing lamp controlled with a simple switch</li>
							<li>How fast can you react? – a game designed by you for your friends</li>
							<li>Boxy – an autonomous robot executing your commands</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
				</ul>
			</li>
			
			<li><b style="color:#FBB040;">Level 2</b>
				<p class="section_head_desc">Continuing from Level 1, students will move onto an advanced level where they will interact
											with more complex components and build smarter gadgets using sensors. Similar to the previous
											level, students will be asked to do some projects on their own for their better understanding
											and confidence.
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Activities</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">More complex activities including sensors, basic communication & display systems are introduced
											with these activities.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Display your name on LCD</li>
							<li>Controlling fan’s speed, buzzer’s sound and lamp’s intensity using programming</li>
							<li>Taking instructions from computer and give results back on screen in real time</li>
							<li>Infrared doorbell which does not need contact to work</li>
							<li>Measuring the RPM of motor</li>
							<li>Make a parking assist for your car</li>
							<li>Constructing fan which auto regulates its speed based on temperature</li>
							<li>Constructing and controlling a boom-barrier</li>
							<li>Control the robot (Boxy) with computer</li>
							<li>Make the robot (Boxy) follow a line on its own</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li><b style="color:#0096FF;">Projects</b>
						<p class="topic_desc">With a minimal assistance from our end, students will work on a variety of projects on their own.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Create your own multimeter</li>
							<li>Complex line follower robot (Boxy)</li>
							<li>Maze solver robot (Boxy)</li>
							<li>Obstacle avoiding robot (Boxy)</li>
							<li>Digital clock with thermometer</li>
							<li>Intelligent street light to switch itself on during low ambient light intensity period</li>
							<li>Self-parking robot (Boxy)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
